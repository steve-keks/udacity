    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "1. Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "    -  Decision Trees are an easy and fast understandable way to visualize the options of decisions and support if for   example a company should invest in the creation vs. purchase of certain products (make-or-buy decision) during the strategic planning phase. (Source: http://www.public.asu.edu/~kirkwood/DAStuff/decisiontrees/DecisionTreePrimer-1.pdf). The decision tree then shows all the options available. <br>\n",
    "    -  The strengths are that they are easy to set up for small decision or classification problems, they are easy to read and understand and can also be combined with others methods. The weaknesses are that they become to confusing for complex classification problems and might also lead to long processing time in complex scenarios, they are unstable (small changed could make them change their structure a lot) (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree#Advantages_and_disadvantages) <br>\n",
    "    -  It could be useful for our data here, because we have quite some features to learn from and it can understand the interaction between after being built.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ensemble Methods (Random Forest)\n",
    "    -  Ensemble methods are used to decrease the variance of one learner by combining it with several learners in order to get a higher precision and better predictions (source: https://blog.statsbot.co/ensemble-learning-d1dcd548e936) which can be used for example to come up with customer recommendations (source: http://www2.islab.ntua.gr/attachments/article/86/Ensemble%20methods%20-%20Zhou.pdf page p.17)\n",
    "    -  The strengths of ensemble methods are the previously mentioned reduction of variance to avoid overfitting, robust performance on outliers. Weaknesses are that a very huge amount of data is needed due to more data splits, additional parameter tuning is necessary cause of the many different learners and the meta learner and the complexity and understanding of the model increases. (source: http://phirilytics.blogspot.com/2017/07/ensemble-model-strengthsand-some.html)\n",
    "    -  Due to the expected lower variance and higher accuracy I think it generates better predictions than \"simple learners\" without a meta learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "    -  Logistic Regression can be used in a bank to decide weather a customer gets a loan or not (source: https://medium.com/@fenjiro/data-mining-for-banking-loan-approval-use-case-e7c2bc3ece3) \n",
    "    -  Advantages are that this methods outputs the relationship between a feature and the output variable, it also shows the impact of a feature towards the output, thus it provides more information between input and output. (source: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-logistic-regression). Disadvantages are e.g. that each observation must be independent from each other which cannot always be guaranteed.

    "### Implementation: Initial Model Evaluation\n",
    "In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.\n",
    "  - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    "  - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.\n",
    "  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Depending on which algorithms you chose, the following implementation may take some time to run!"

    "We have 2 groups of people that we are interested in - the one's that earn more than 50k $ and the ones that earn less than 50k $. Based on our the information we have (training data) the algorithms splits these two groups in the best possible way.\n",
    "Think about a soccer field where you normally have 22 players and assume that the players are spread everywhere on the field randomly and stand still. You can have some players (e.g. attackers) that are close to the opponents goal but also defenders that are close to the own goal from each team. When you look at this snapshot of the match you draw a line - lets say the centerline - and then look at the players. This centerline is what our algorithm does. It draws this line in the best possible spot supporting the hypothesis that when a player is on the left side the player belongs to team A and when a player is on the right side he belongs to team B. Problem is, that this sport is so dynamic that the position of the players normally changes very fast and thus we can only assume in the snapshot of the match to which team a player belongs - we talk about the probability the algorithms puts out for a player to be classified with the right team.\n",
    "Lets now say that there are some players on the left side of the centerline which normally belong to team B and vice versa. This is what we want to avoid, but which not completely possible because the players are distributed all over the field randomly.\n",
    "The algorithm looks at e.g. 15 players out of these 22 and then draws this line between the players in the most optimal way, but he hasnt's seen all of the players thats why there can be mistakes for the remaining 7 players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets translate it now to our 2 groups of people we want to classify. These two teams are the two groups of people that we want to identify. we are very sure (f-score of 0.7) that when we see a next player (one out of the 7) that we say the right team, based on our experience with quite some confidence.\n",

    "The optimized model accuracy score and F-score aver slightly better than the unoptimized model values. That means that the optimization did not bring a lot of additional value. A very slight increase of the F-Score by 0.001 is also not very significant. Thus the trained model on the whole training data set (unoptimized) was already in a very good place. Optimization with Gridsearch means that certain spots of parameters (grid) were only compared. The assumption is close that the unoptimized model is a local or even global maximum but it cannot be excluded that there are better scores for accuracy and F-score. \n",

    "But compared to the Naive Predictor from Q1 [Accuracy score: 0.2478, F-score: 0.2917], we made huge progress. An increase of accuracy by almost 0.6, meaning that 8 out of 10 predictions are correct now (before 2.4 out of 10) and an increase of the F-score by around 0.38 meaning that the predictions are more accurate, show that it was a very good decision to use a supervised learning approach for this problem.

    "I thought about this ranking, since the older a person is, the more he/she earns and thus i thought it's the most relevant for the income classes. In addition different jobs also mean different salary and if a person works in a highly payed job, then the income class tends towards >50k $. Thus I tought that the occupation has a huge impact as well. The higher a person is educated the higher a salary should be, based on my naive assumption. So i thought about it as an important feature as well. It is also obvious i thought, that the native-country also has an effect on the salary due to different living conditions and certain GDPs the country of origin might also have an impact on the income group, which apparently was not the case in this dataset. And the there is more this minor issue of women earning basically less than men, which is a more sociological issue, thus i thought this also has an effect on the income here, but not as important as the age for example.\n",

    "except age, which I set as the most important, all my features are do not appear in this Top 5 imporant features from the adaboost classifier. The age feature makes sense, since a rookie in the working environment normally doesn't earn as much as a very experiences employee.\n",
    "Concerning all the other features i thought that an occupation has a bigger impact in the income since there are low payed jobs where it's unlikely to earn less than 50k $ and jobs like professors/management seem to me more likely/relevant for higher salaries. But here it can also depend on the country where someone works. My next guess concerning the educational-level was also wrong, but that education has an impact shows the education-num as Top 5th features. probably the level leaves more room for interpretation than the education-num.\n",
    "Native country and sex were very qualitative guesses, since there is a huge gap between rich and poor countries which in my opinion should have a quite huge impact on the salary and the difference betweeen men and women has been a controversal topic in the past, which is still not equal in every field. probably this is a too small gap for a bigger impact on the income classificaton problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Features like capital loss and capital gain were surprising for me. I can just imagine that the more capital some lost the harder, which can be the case only for rich(er) people, the higher the impact on the income group is. The same with capital-gain, people with high capital-gain tend to already have/earn more, which is a realtive issue.\n",
    "Hours-per-week also makes sense, since time is money and normally when you spend more time at work you should earn more money. that should be a linear correlation. This features now makes more and more sense while thinking about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, I can say that one has to really understand the data well in the beginning and features-extraction methods definetely help a lot to focus on the very right issues, which is a very strong advantage of machine learning."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
